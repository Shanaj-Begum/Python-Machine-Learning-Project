# Python-Machine-Learning-Project
We have used a dataset containing different car features along with the actual price. Our project is to create a model that can predict actual car 
price using supervised machine learning method. OLS model with regularization, Extratrees regressor, Random forest regressor and Gradient tree boosting 
regressor were used . Accuracy is validated using CV score and RMSE score.
